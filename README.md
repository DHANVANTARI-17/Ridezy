This project is an Ambulance Booking System that allows users to book ambulances, notifies ambulances within a 10km radius, and manages ride workflows. The system is built using **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Socket.io** for real-time communication. Payment integration is also enabled for ride payments.

---

## **Features**

1. **User Features:**
   - Register and log in as a user.
   - Book an ambulance ride by providing pickup and destination addresses.
   - View estimated arrival time for the ambulance.
   - Make payments for rides.

2. **Ambulance Features:**
   - Register and log in as an ambulance driver.
   - Receive notifications for ride requests within a 10km radius.
   - Accept or reject ride requests.
   - Start and end rides.

3. **Real-Time Communication:**
   - Notifications are sent to ambulances within the radius using **Socket.io**.

4. **Geospatial Queries:**
   - MongoDB geospatial indexing is used to find ambulances within a 10km radius.

5. **Payment Integration:**
   - Users can securely pay for rides using the integrated payment system.

## **Workflow**

1. **User Books a Ride:**
   - The user provides pickup and destination addresses.
   - The system calculates the estimated arrival time.
   - Notifications are sent to all ambulances within a 10km radius.

2. **Ambulance Receives Notification:**
   - Ambulances in the radius receive a real-time notification.
   - An ambulance driver can accept the ride.

3. **Ride Confirmation:**
   - Once an ambulance accepts the ride, the user is notified.
   - The ride status is updated to "accepted."

4. **Ride Progress:**
   - The ambulance driver starts the ride after verifying the user.
   - The ride status is updated to "ongoing."

5. **Ride Completion:**
   - The ambulance driver ends the ride.
   - The ride status is updated to "completed."

6. **Payment:**
   - The user makes a payment for the completed ride.
